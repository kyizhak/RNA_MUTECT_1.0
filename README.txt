RNA-MuTect
----------

*****************************************
The pipeline uses the following software:
1. samtools (1.2+)
2. bamtools (1.0.2+)
3. PLINK/SEQ (0.08+)
4. zlib (1.2.6+)
5. HiSat2 (2.0.3-beta)
6. MuTect (1.1.6)
7. Matlab (2016a+)
*****************************************

* Example outputs for a TCGA sample are provided 

Input: 
------
1. A matched-normal DNA BAM file
2. RNA BAM file aligned with STAR. Parameters used to run STAR are found in Supplementary Table 14.
3. A MAF file listing inital set of mutations called by MuTect with the -U ALLOW_N_CIGAR_READS flag. Other callers and filters may be used as well as long as the output file is in a MAF format.

* For example MAF see: example_RNA_vs_DNA_somatic_pair_RNA.txt in example_output directory

To run the RNA-MuTect pipeline please follow these steps:
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Realignment step:

  a. sh HiSat_realign_preprocess.sh <Dir> <MAF_file>  <RNA_BAM_file>  <Reference_genome_fasta_format> <case_sample_ID>
  b. sh HiSat_realign_preprocess.sh <Dir> <MAF_file>  <Matched-normal_DNA_BAM_file>  <Reference_genome_fasta_format> <control_sample_ID>
     
  Each of these steps will extract from the corresponding BAM file all the reads that are aligned with the called mutations regions and will write them into fastq files.
  A text file with the path to the new fastq files will be generated.
     
  <Dir> - directory with jar files (FilterSamReads; GenomeAnalysisTK; picard; SamToFastq) This jar files were taken from: The Genome Analysis Toolkit: a MapReduce framework for analyzing next-generation DNA sequencing data McKenna A, Hanna M, Banks E, Sivachenko A, Cibulskis K, Kernytsky A, Garimella K, Altshuler D, Gabriel S, Daly M, DePristo MA, 2010 GENOME RESEARCH 20:1297-303 
  <MAF_file> - input MAF file
  <RNA_BAM_file> - BAM file of the RNA sample
  <Reference_genome_fasta_format> - reference genome in a fasta format that matches the input BAM file (hg19)
  <case_sample_ID>/<control_sample_ID> - ID of input sample
     
  Output:
  -------
  1. sample_ID.rna_reads_fastq_list.list - A text file with the path to the two generated fastq files
  Running time: ~1 hour, for ~2000 initially called variants

  c. run the HiSat2 aligner for the case sample with the parameters specified in Supplementary Table 14 and fastq files list generated in (a)
  d. run the HiSat2 aligner for the control sample with the parameters specified in Supplementary Table 14 and fastq files list generated in (b)
  
  Output:
    -------
  1. case_sample_ID.aligned.sorted_by_coord.hisat2.bam - A HiSat2 aligned BAM file for the case sample
  2. control_sample_ID.aligned.sorted_by_coord.hisat2.bam - A HiSat2 aligned BAM file for the control sample
  Running time: ~10 minutes, for ~2000 initially called variants
  
  e. Run MuTect with:
     1. The HiSat BAMs (generated in (c) and (d))
     2. The -U ALLOW_N_CIGAR_READS flag
     3. The --force_output flag
     4. An interval list containing chromosome and position of mutations listed in the input MAF file (format = 'chromosome:position', each mutation in different line)
     
  Output:
  -------
  1. pair_ID.call_stats.txt - A call_stats file which is used as put for the next step.  
  Running time: ~1 hour, for ~2000 initially called variants
  * For example MAF see: example_RNA_vs_DNA_somatic_pair_RNA.call_stats.no_germline.txt in example_output directory. Note that suspected germline variants were moved from this file.
  
     
2. Filtering steps (includes two matlab scripts):    
  a. ./run_FilterRNAMutations.sh <Matlab_Runtime_Location> <pair_ID> <MAF_file> <call_stats_file> <MIN_ALT_COUNT> <PON_THR> <Darned_mat.mat> <Radar_mat.mat> <Exac_mat.mat> <PoN_GTEx>
     <Matlab_Runtime_Location> - path to matlab runtime
     <pair_ID> - ID of the input pair 
     <MAF_file> - input MAF file
     <call_stats_file> - output of Step 1
     <MIN_ALT_COUNT> - the minimal number of reads required supporting the alternate allele (MIN_ALT_COUNT=3 was used in the paper for TCGA samples and MIN_ALT_COUNT=4 for GTEx samples)
     <PON_THR> - A threshold for PoN filtering (PON_THR=-3 was used in the paper)
     <Darned_mat.mat> - input file found in directory (mat_files) - downloaded on September 2015 - Kiran A, O'Mahony J, Sanjeev K, Baranov PV (2013) Darned in 2013: Inclusion of model organisms and linking with Wikipedia. Nucleic Acids Res, Epub ahead of print
